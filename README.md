This code is only a exmaple of one work which was made in class to learn to work with color magnitude diagram and comparate them with 
synthetic cmd generate with the iac page. In this code you can see how to plot a color magnitude diagram and count point beside a 
region that you can personalize.

If you want to try it you need to go to the website http://iac-star.iac.es/cmd/www/form.htm and generate one synthetic cmd with the 
parameters that you prefers and you would comparate this one with the file cmd_Nbajo.txt.
